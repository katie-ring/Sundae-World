Define a class called pizza that has member variables to track the type of pizza (either deep dish, hand tossed, or thin crust) along with the size (small, medium, or large) and the number of pepperoni or cheese toppings. You can use constants to represent the type and size. Create a void function, outputDescription(), that outputs a textual description of the pizza object. Also include a function, computePrice(), that computes the cost of the pizza and returns it as s double according to the rules:

Small pizza = $10 + $2 per topping

Medium pizza = $14 + $2 per topping

Large pizza = $17 + $2 per topping

Include constructors and any other functions needed to make the class work well. 

Add an order class that contains a private vector of type Pizza. This class represents a customer’s entire order, where the order may consist of multiple pizzas. Include appropriate functions so that a user of the Order class can add pizzas to the order. Also write a function that outputs everything in the order along with the total price. Include any other functions that are needed. 

Include a static variable to keep track of the total number of pizzas sold and a static function to output the number of pizzas sold when the user exits the program. 

Write a suitable test program that adds multiple pizzas to an order, and will create more than one order. 

Feel free to use some creativity with this one. If you don’t want to use pizzas, you can write it for something else such as ice cream sundaes, as long as it mostly fits the requirements for the problem (2 classes and uses a vector and a static variable).
